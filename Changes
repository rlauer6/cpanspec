* Assume that *.inl is a hint that this isn't noarch.
* It's 2009.  Update Copyright.

1.77    2008-06-16

* Only use --nodeps if we're only building a source rpm.

1.76    2008-06-16

* Drop dependency on Module::CoreList and just fetch the list from rpm.

1.75    2008-05-05

* Try $] as-is and numeric when we use it with Module::CoreList.
* Switch from wget to curl in cpanget since wget is broken in Fedora 9.
* The best README is probably the one with the shortest filename.

1.74    2007-12-11

* Maybe finally handle "v" in version number correctly.
* Continue on YAML errors.

* Filter repoquery results better.

1.72    2007-07-13

* It's 2007 now, so update the copyright.
* Handle .bz2 files.
* Exclude config.guess, config.sub, and install.sh (usually seen near
  configure.)
* Add option processing to cpanget.  It now accepts the following options:

  -h          Print usage message
  -n          Don't download, only print URLs
  -q          Work quietly

1.70    2007-03-12

* Delete pm_to_blib if it exists.

1.69    2006-10-03

* Exclude autobuild.sh.
* Change regex to also drop leading "an" or "the" from Summary.
* Tiny whitespace fix.
* Add patch from Chris Weyl to add --prefer-macros and handle modules
  specified as Foo-Bar instead of Foo::Bar (SF#1546966).
* Originally -V was going to be the same as --version, but for some
  reason it doesn't really work.  The documentation has been updated.

1.68    2006-07-20

* Fix find option ordering (patch from Ville Skytt√§, #199442).
