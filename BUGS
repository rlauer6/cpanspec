* This script is known to fail on the following:

    - perlmenu 4.0 (*horrible* file name, paths in the tar file, etc.)
    - Data::Dump::Streamer 2.08-40
      (error: line 2: Illegal char '-' in version: Version:        2.08-40)
    - Mail::ClamAV 0.22 (uses Inline, so it isn't noarch)

* PAR 0.92 is arch-specific because of stuff in %{_bindir}, not
  %{perl_vendorarch}.  There's probably a way to detect that.

* There is logic to exclude directories from %doc, but it doesn't
  seem to work all that often.

* Scripts aren't added to %files reliably.  Man pages for scripts are
  never added.

* We should exclude zero-length items from %doc.
